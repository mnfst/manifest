- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items passed validation
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults for edge cases
