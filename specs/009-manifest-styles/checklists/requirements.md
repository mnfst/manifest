## Notes

- Specification passed all quality checks
- Violet (#6b21a8) was selected as the "fun strong color" - provides 12.6:1 contrast ratio with white text, exceeding WCAG AAA requirements
- Design tokens from Manifest (Inter font, color palette) have been documented for implementation reference
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
