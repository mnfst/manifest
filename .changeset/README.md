# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`.

## What is this?

The `.changeset` folder is used to manage versioning and changelogs for this monorepo.

## How do I add a changeset?

When you make a change to any package, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed (`manifest` and/or `manifest-ui`)
2. Choose a semver bump type (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

A markdown file will be created in this folder describing your changes.

## When are changesets required?

Changesets are required for PRs that modify:
- `packages/manifest/**` (the flow editor application)
- `packages/manifest-ui/**` (the UI component registry)

The CI will fail if you modify these packages without adding a changeset.

## Semantic Versioning

- **patch**: Bug fixes, small improvements (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
- **minor**: New features, non-breaking changes (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
- **major**: Breaking changes (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
