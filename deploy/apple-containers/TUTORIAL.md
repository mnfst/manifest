# Run Manifest with Apple Containers

This guide runs Manifest and PostgreSQL on Apple silicon using Apple's [`container`](https://github.com/apple/container) CLI. The deployment mirrors the bundled Docker Compose stack while accounting for differences in Apple Containers networking and storage.

## Prerequisites

- An Apple silicon Mac running a supported macOS version.
- The Apple Containers `container` CLI installed from the [Apple Containers releases](https://github.com/apple/container/releases).
- This Manifest repository checked out locally.
- `curl` and OpenSSL, which are included with macOS.

Confirm the CLI is available:

```bash
container --version
```

### After upgrading Apple Containers

The CLI and its persistent background services must run the same version. Homebrew or package upgrades can replace the CLI while leaving an older `container-apiserver` running. That mismatch may surface as `builtin network is not present`, decoding errors, or missing default-network state.

After every Apple Containers upgrade, restart its services once:

```bash
container system stop
container system start --enable-kernel-install
container system version
```

The `container` and `container-apiserver` rows should report the same version. Startup also checks this and prints these recovery commands instead of continuing with mismatched components.

## Configure Manifest

The script reads `docker/.env`, the same configuration file used by Docker Compose.

Create it from the example if it does not exist:

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
```

Generate a Better Auth secret and add it to `docker/.env`:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

```env
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<paste-the-generated-value>
```

For stronger separation between session signing and encrypted provider credentials, generate another value and set:

```env
MANIFEST_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<a-different-generated-value>
```

The default dashboard URL is `http://localhost:2099`. To use another port, set `PORT` and keep `BETTER_AUTH_URL` aligned:

```env
PORT=3001
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

You can use a different configuration file by exporting `MANIFEST_ENV_FILE`:

```bash
MANIFEST_ENV_FILE=/path/to/manifest.env ./deploy/apple-containers/start.sh up
```

Explicitly exported environment variables take precedence over values in the file.

### Custom PostgreSQL password

The default bundled database password is `manifest`. To change it, set both variables as described in `docker/.env.example`:

```env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change-me
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://manifest:change-me@postgres:5432/manifest
```

The script replaces the Compose hostname `postgres` with the PostgreSQL container's current IP. Percent-encode URL-special characters in the `DATABASE_URL` password.

`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` initializes a new database volume; changing it later does not rotate the password stored by PostgreSQL. If the persistent volume already exists, either keep its original password or rotate the `manifest` PostgreSQL role explicitly.

## Start Manifest

From the repository root, run:

```bash
./deploy/apple-containers/start.sh up
```

`up` is also the default command:

```bash
./deploy/apple-containers/start.sh
```

The script:

1. Starts the Apple Containers service.
2. Creates or reuses the `mnfst-postgres-data` named volume.
3. Starts PostgreSQL and verifies an authenticated connection.
4. Discovers the PostgreSQL container address.
5. Recreates the Manifest container so it always receives the current database address.
6. Publishes the dashboard on host loopback and waits for `/api/v1/health`.

When startup succeeds, open:

```text
http://localhost:2099
```

On first boot, complete the setup wizard at `/setup` to create the admin account.

## Manage the Stack

Show container state and the dashboard URL:

```bash
./deploy/apple-containers/start.sh status
```

Stop and remove both containers:

```bash
./deploy/apple-containers/start.sh down
```

The PostgreSQL named volume is retained, so a later `up` restores the same database.

Running `up` repeatedly is safe. A running PostgreSQL container is reused, while Manifest is recreated to pick up the current PostgreSQL IP and configuration.

## Local LLM Servers

Apple Containers does not provide Docker's `host.docker.internal` hostname. By default, the script uses the container network gateway for Ollama:

```text
http://<gateway-ip>:11434
```

A host LLM server must listen on an interface reachable through that gateway. A service bound only to `127.0.0.1` cannot be reached from the container.

For Ollama, configure `OLLAMA_HOST` on the macOS host according to Ollama's documentation. Avoid exposing the service broadly unless your firewall and network are trusted. You can also point Manifest at another reachable endpoint through `docker/.env`:

```env
OLLAMA_HOST=http://192.168.1.50:11434
```

## Networking and VPNs

The dashboard is published to `127.0.0.1`, providing a stable URL that does not depend on Apple Containers' private subnet and is less likely to conflict with VPN routes.

PostgreSQL-to-Manifest traffic still uses the private address assigned by Apple Containers. The script discovers that address on every `up` and recreates Manifest accordingly. If Apple Containers cannot create or inspect its network while a VPN is active:

1. Run `./deploy/apple-containers/start.sh down`.
2. Temporarily disconnect the VPN.
3. Run `./deploy/apple-containers/start.sh up`.
4. Reconnect the VPN and verify `http://localhost:2099/api/v1/health`.

The script prints the complete `container inspect` output if it cannot identify the required network addresses.

## Persistence and Backups

PostgreSQL data is stored in the Apple Containers named volume `mnfst-postgres-data`. Override the volume name before startup with:

```bash
MANIFEST_PG_VOLUME=my-manifest-data ./deploy/apple-containers/start.sh up
```

The script mounts the named volume at `/var/lib/postgresql/data` and uses `/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata` as `PGDATA`. The nested directory is required because a newly formatted Apple Containers volume may contain a root-level `lost+found` directory.

`down` never deletes the named volume. Use Apple Containers volume commands to inspect or deliberately remove it:

```bash
container volume inspect mnfst-postgres-data
container volume delete mnfst-postgres-data
```

Deleting the volume permanently deletes the bundled PostgreSQL database. Back up important data before removing it.

## Troubleshooting

### `builtin network is not present`

This usually means Apple Containers was upgraded while its older background services kept running. Compare component versions and restart the services:

```bash
container system version
container system stop
container system start --enable-kernel-install
container network inspect default
```

If `container system stop` prints protocol or decoding errors, continue with `container system start --enable-kernel-install`; the stop command still unloads the old services after attempting to stop containers. The final inspect command should show the recreated builtin `default` network.

### View logs

```bash
container logs mnfst-postgres
container logs mnfst-manifest
```

### PostgreSQL stops during initialization

If logs mention `lost+found`, confirm the script sets:

```text
PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
```

If logs mention `chmod` or `chown` being denied, do not replace the named volume with a macOS bind mount. The official PostgreSQL image needs filesystem ownership changes that Apple Containers bind mounts do not provide.

### PostgreSQL rejects the password

The named volume was probably initialized with a different password. Restore the original `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, or rotate the database role password inside PostgreSQL and update `DATABASE_URL` to match.

### Manifest stops before becoming healthy

The script prints the container logs automatically. You can inspect them again with:

```bash
container logs mnfst-manifest
```

Common causes include a mismatched database URL, a port already in use, or invalid environment values.

### Port already in use

Choose another port in `docker/.env`:

```env
PORT=2100
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:2100
```

Then rerun `up`.

### Reset the deployment

Stop the containers first:

```bash
./deploy/apple-containers/start.sh down
```

To also discard all database state, deliberately delete the named volume:

```bash
container volume delete mnfst-postgres-data
```

Then run `up` again. This is destructive and returns Manifest to a fresh-install state.
