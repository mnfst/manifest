## Main features

- Create instantaneously a professional **CRUD app** ⚡
- **No need for learning** new stuff 🧠
- Nice and clear **UI** ✨

## Forget about the framework, focus on your data

When you want to develop quickly an app, often the **choice of the framework(s)** quickly takes up all the space in the discussions. That's why CASE took the approach to remove it so you can focus on your data.

CASE's purpose is to **allow developers to create quickly CRUD apps without having to deal with frameworks** by developers describe the data and the events.
