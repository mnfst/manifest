## What is CASE ?

CASE is a tool that helps developers to create nice data-intensive apps like **dashboards**, **custom web apps**, **admin panels**, **ERPs** very quickly.

CASE follows a clear **frameworkless approach** and forces developers to focus on their data and their business logic.

## Main features

- Create instantaneously a professional **CRUD app** ⚡
- **No need for learning** new stuff 🧠
- Nice and clear **UI** ✨

## Forget about the framework, focus on your data

When you want to develop quickly an app, often the **choice of the framework(s)** quickly takes up all the space in the discussions. That's why CASE took the approach to remove it so you can focus on your data.
