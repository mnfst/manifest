/**
 * Transparent stale-while-revalidate (SWR) cache for dashboard GET requests.
 *
 * The dashboard router unmounts/remounts every page on navigation, so each page's
 * `createResource` re-runs from scratch on every tab switch — a full refetch of
 * Overview → Messages → Subscriptions → back every single time. This module sits
 * behind the shared GET helper (`fetchJson`) and serves cached payloads keyed by
 * request URL so navigation feels instant without going stale.
 *
 * Design choices (documented per the implementation brief):
 *
 * - **Default-on for GETs, explicit deny-list + per-call opt-out.** Caching every
 *   GET by default is what makes navigation transparently fast (pages don't have
 *   to opt in). A small deny-list (`isCacheable`) excludes always-fresh/sensitive
 *   endpoints, and callers can force a bypass with `fetchJson(path, params, { cache: false })`.
 * - **Short TTL (30s).** Long enough to make back-and-forth navigation feel
 *   instant, short enough that data is never meaningfully stale even without an
 *   SSE invalidation. SSE events (`services/sse.ts`) invalidate the relevant key
 *   groups immediately, so the TTL is just a backstop.
 * - **Stale-while-revalidate.** A stale-but-present entry is returned immediately
 *   while a background refetch updates the cache, so the UI never blocks on the
 *   network for a key it has seen recently.
 * - **In-flight de-duplication.** Concurrent identical GETs share one promise so a
 *   page that mounts several resources hitting the same URL only fires one request.
 * - **Never cache failures.** Only resolved 2xx payloads are stored; a rejected
 *   fetch leaves the cache untouched so the next call retries.
