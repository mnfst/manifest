/**
 * PRESERVATION SPEC — do not delete with the component.
 *
 * "Error classes by frequency" (ErrorClassCard) was deliberately UNMOUNTED
 * from the dashboards because the backend does not yet aggregate real
 * error_class data. Product intent: reintroduce the SAME widget once the
 * backend can populate it (see the component's header comment).
 *
 * This spec pins the component so it survives until then:
 *  - it must keep rendering from an ErrorBreakdownResponse ({ by_class }),
 *  - it must keep its title and its bar-per-class layout,
 *  - it must keep its empty state.
 *
 * If you are reintroducing the widget: mount <ErrorClassCard range=… /> on
 * GlobalOverview/Overview, wire GET /overview/error-breakdown to real data,
 * and replace this preservation spec with real page-level coverage.
