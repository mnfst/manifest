## Contribute

To contribute to the Manifest JS SDK, please read first the general [contributing.md](https://github.com/mnfst/manifest/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

The best way to work with the SDK is using the `/sandbox` folder that hosts a minimalistic React app that imports the Manifest SDK. You can run the app with the following commands:

```bash
cd sandbox
npm install
npm run dev
```
