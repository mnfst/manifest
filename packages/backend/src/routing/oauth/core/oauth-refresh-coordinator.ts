/**
 * Single-flight coordinator for lazy OAuth access-token refreshes.
 *
 * Why this exists (issue #2012): providers like OpenAI now issue ROTATING
 * refresh tokens — every successful refresh invalidates the old refresh token
 * and returns a new one. The naive "parse blob → refresh(blob.r) → persist"
 * path each `unwrapToken()` used has two fatal races under that model:
 *
 *   1. Concurrent requests. An agent fires many parallel requests against an
 *      expired token. Each one parsed its own (stale) blob and calls the
 *      provider with the SAME old refresh token. The first rotates it; every
 *      other one gets `refresh_token_invalidated` and fails.
 *
 *   2. Persist-after-rotate failure. If the DB write fails AFTER the provider
 *      already rotated, the only copy of the new refresh token is lost while
 *      the stored one is already dead — the account is bricked until the user
 *      reconnects (exactly issue #2012).
 *
 * Layered protection:
 *
 *   - In-process single-flight (this file): concurrent requests on one
 *     backend instance coalesce onto one refresh promise.
 *   - DB row lock (`withLock`, usually SELECT … FOR UPDATE on
 *     tenant_providers): multi-replica deploys serialize the critical
 *     section so two instances cannot rotate the same refresh token.
 *   - Inside the lock: re-read the blob, skip refresh if already valid,
 *     then refresh + persist with retries (never re-refresh on persist fail).
