# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a custom shadcn component registry built with Next.js 15 and Tailwind v4. It allows distributing custom components, hooks, pages, and other files to any React project using the `shadcn` CLI.

## Commands

```bash
# Development server (uses Turbopack)
pnpm dev

# Build the Next.js app
pnpm build

# Build the registry (generates static JSON files)
pnpm registry:build

# Lint
pnpm lint
```

## Architecture

### Registry System

The registry is defined in `registry.json` and uses the shadcn registry schema. Each registry item specifies:
- `name`: Component identifier (used in `shadcn add <name>`)
- `type`: Usually `registry:component`
- `files`: Array of file paths with their types (`registry:component`, `registry:page`, `registry:lib`, `registry:hook`)
- `dependencies`: npm packages required
- `registryDependencies`: Other registry items this depends on (e.g., `button`, `card`)

### Directory Structure

- `registry/new-york/blocks/` - Custom composite components (blocks that combine multiple primitives)
- `registry/new-york/ui/` - Base UI primitives (button, card, input, label, textarea)
- `app/` - Next.js app router pages for previewing components
- `public/r/[name].json` - Built registry items served as static files (generated by `registry:build`)

### Component Style

Uses the "new-york" shadcn style with:
- Tailwind CSS v4
- CSS variables for theming
- Lucide icons
- Server Components enabled (RSC: true)

### Adding New Components

1. Create component files in `registry/new-york/blocks/<component-name>/`
2. Add entry to `registry.json` with proper file paths and dependencies
3. Run `pnpm registry:build` to generate the distributable JSON
4. Import in `app/page.tsx` to preview
