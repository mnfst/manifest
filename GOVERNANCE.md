## Decision Making

### Minor Decisions
Day-to-day decisions (bug fixes, small features, docs updates) can be made by any maintainer through the normal PR review process.

### Major Decisions
Decisions that significantly impact the project require broader consensus:

**Major decisions include:**

- New package additions
- Architecture changes
- Brand/naming changes
- License changes
- Governance changes

**Process:**
1. Create a GitHub Discussion proposing the change
2. Allow at least 2 weeks for community input
3. Maintainers discuss and vote
4. Requires 75% maintainer approval
5. Document decision in discussion

### Emergency Decisions
Security fixes and critical bugs can be addressed immediately by any maintainer, with retroactive notification to other maintainers.

## Conflict Resolution

1. **Discussion** - Start with good-faith discussion
2. **Mediation** - If unresolved, request mediation from uninvolved maintainer
3. **Vote** - If still unresolved, maintainers vote (simple majority)
4. **Escalation** - Core team (@mnfst) makes final decision if needed
