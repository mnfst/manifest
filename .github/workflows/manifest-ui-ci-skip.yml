# Manifest UI CI Skip Workflow
# ============================================================================
# Companion to manifest-ui-ci.yml. Reports the required "lint & test" check
# as successful when no manifest-ui files are changed in a PR.
#
# Why: The "lint & test" check is required by the branch ruleset, but
# manifest-ui-ci.yml only triggers for packages/manifest-ui/** changes.
# Without this workflow, PRs that don't touch manifest-ui would have the
# required check stuck as "pending", blocking merge.
