# ============================================================================
# Manifest Package Tests Workflow
# ============================================================================
# Runs tests for the manifest package when changes are detected.
#
# Note: Uses pull_request_target in addition to pull_request to handle
# automated changeset PRs (created by github-actions[bot]). Workflows
# triggered by GITHUB_TOKEN don't trigger other workflows, so we need
# pull_request_target which runs even for bot-created PRs.
